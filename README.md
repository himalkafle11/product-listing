# Product Listing

This project is a React-based frontend for an e-commerce application, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- **Product Listing:** Displays a list of products with pagination.
- **Product Details:** Shows detailed information about each product.
- **Cart Management:** Allows users to add items to the cart, view cart details, and update item quantities.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Automatically updates cart and product information using React hooks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

4. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
